Implement a menu-driven system where the user can:
Add a Student
Add a Teacher
Add a Course
Assign Courses to Students
Assign Courses to Teachers
View Student by ID
View every Student and Teacher
View every Course
Update Student
Delete Student
Exit
Use separate lists for students, teachers, and courses. You can use an ArrayList for each.
CRUD Operations:
Create: Ability to add new students, teachers, and courses. When you are generating IDs for students and courses, make sure they are unique. Your IDs should be set up in a way where they are not manually inputted but rather auto-generated by your code
Read: Ability to view all students, teachers, or courses.
Update: Ability to update details (like student name, age, etc.) for students or teachers.
Delete: Ability to remove students, teachers, or courses.
Inheritance:
Students and teachers inherit common attributes (name, age, email) from the Person class.
Encapsulation
Basic encapsulation principles should be implemented such as private instance variables that can only be accessed via getters or modified via setters
Ensure that names and emails entered are not blank, ages are not negative, etc.
Array Manipulation:
Students and teachers can enroll in or teach multiple courses.
Ensure each student can take up to 5 courses, and each teacher can teach up to 3 courses.
Code Quality: Java best practices should be followed and code should be commented
